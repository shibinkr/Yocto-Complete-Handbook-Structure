# 7. Debugging & Optimization

The Yocto Project can be complex, and understanding how to debug builds and optimize them is crucial for efficient development. This chapter covers common issues, techniques for inspecting builds, and methods to optimize build performance and final image size.

---

## 7.1 Common Yocto Build Errors and Fixes
- **Missing dependencies**: Check `DEPENDS` and `RDEPENDS` in recipes; ensure required packages or layers are included.
- **Patch failures**: Ensure patches apply cleanly; update or modify `.patch` files for new versions.
- **Permission errors**: Verify file permissions in `do_install()` tasks.
- **Checksum mismatches**: Run `bitbake -c fetch <recipe>` to re-download sources.

---

## 7.2 Using `bitbake -e` and `bitbake -c` Commands
- **`bitbake -e <recipe>`**: Shows environment variables for a recipe, helping debug variable expansion and paths.
- **`bitbake -c <task> <recipe>`**: Run a specific task (fetch, configure, compile, install) to isolate issues.
- **Example**:  
  ```bash
  bitbake -c cleanall my-image
  bitbake -c compile my-recipe
  ```
---

## 7.3 Debugging Recipe Dependencies

- **`bitbake -g <recipe>`**: Generates dependency graphs (`task-depends.dot`, `pn-depends.dot`) for visual inspection.
- Check for cycles or missing dependencies that may cause build failures.
- **Visualize the graph**:  
  ```bash
  dot -Tpng task-depends.dot -o deps.png
  ```

## 7.4 Reducing Image Size

- **Strip binaries**: Remove debug symbols from executables and libraries.  
- **BusyBox**: Use BusyBox for core utilities to reduce footprint.  
- **Minimal images**: Start from `core-image-minimal` and only add required packages.  
- **Remove unnecessary files**: Exclude docs, locale data, and temporary files using `EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES`.  

---

## 7.5 Performance Tuning and Build Acceleration

- **ccache**: Cache compiled objects to speed up rebuilds.  
- **sstate mirror**: Share cached build outputs across machines.  
- **Parallel builds**: Set `BB_NUMBER_THREADS` and `PARALLEL_MAKE` in `local.conf`.  
- **Layer optimization**: Avoid redundant layers or recipes; prefer prebuilt packages when possible.

âœ… **Summary**  
Effective debugging, dependency management, and build optimization in Yocto are essential to save time, reduce image size, and accelerate development. Combining task-specific commands, caching mechanisms, and minimal images ensures smoother and faster builds.
